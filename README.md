# behavior-driven-python
This repository contains example projects for the following
[Python](https://automationpanda.com/python/)
[BDD](https://automationpanda.com/bdd/) test frameworks:

* [behave](http://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* [pytest-bdd](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd)

The example projects (in the subdirectories)
include full tests and documentation.
They are companions to Python conference talks and the
[Automation Panda](https://automationpanda.com/) blog.

The feature files in each project are practically identical.
However, the step definitions and related implementations are different
because they depend upon the framework.

The `cucumbers.py` module contains a simple *CucumberBasket* class.
The example projects share it for unit testing.
